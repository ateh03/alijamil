            <p>On January 9th, 2020, Robert Williams was arrested for stealing thousands of dollars worth of watches from luxury store Shinola. After the exploited store owner provided the Detroit police with grainy surveillance footage at the time of the robbery, it was sent up to the Michigan police department for review through their facial recognition system. The facial recognition technology (FRT) revealed Williams to the perpetrator, and he was told to surrender himself and spent the next 18 hours facing harsh detainment, and the 12 after that imprisoned. What would be a commendable effort on behalf of FRT and artificial intelligence (AI) in a forensics setting quickly becomes a cautionary tale, as Robert Williams in fact did not commit the crime he was incarcerated for. He was misidentified by the police station’s FRT for another black man.
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, after the shocking account of Robert Williams speaks volumes on the state of a real-life AI crisis. One where the majority of the public faces misidentification in FRT and other AI systems. According to the Washington Post, Asian and African-American people were up to 100 times more likely to be misidentified than white men, depending on algorithm and search (Washington Post, 2019). Another great example of misidentification in AI systems can be examined in the White Obama case study, where an AI upscaling pixelated images failed to account for people of color, even registering a turban as hair. As a black and iranian male myself, my facial features are far from conventional. My unique features that I cannot alter in any  way would certainly cause misidentification in some of these systems. Therein lies the problem– people being inadvertently marginalized due to a lack of care nor representation in the labs making these systems. While I haven’t had any first-hand experiences regarding misidentification, this prevalent issue could affect any minority demographic. The crux of the matter with certain AI systems like facial recognition, <span title="Natural Language Processing - AI system that understands text and spoken words like humans do" style="color:red">natural language processing (NLP)</span> and consumer-AI devices is that they often don’t work as intended for people of certain racial or ethnic backgrounds. This shows the inherent bias that many AI systems have, directly caused by a shortage of diversity in the labs that formulate these algorithms and collect data. These deployed systems are often not trained on data that includes a variety of diverse individuals. While machine learning (ML) is self-taught, withholding integral data representative of a demographic prevents the AI/ML systems from working effectively for all users.
