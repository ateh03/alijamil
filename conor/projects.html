        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>A page dedicated to going into a bit more depth on some of the coding projects I have worked on, from various points throughout my life. I have been programming for quite some time, and have maintained a GitHub account since June 2015, so some of the projects vary in quality. This list is incomplete, and I will update it as I have time. They are sorted from most to least recent by start date.</p>

        <p>For hackathon <a href="https://www.tribehacks.com/">Cypher VIII</a>, I created this browser-based Rhythm game from scratch. While the game is in continuing development, the logic began with extensive functionality, including event-based beatmaps, dynamic graphs with automatic inbetweening, all featured in the linked demonstration video.</p>

        <p>A collaborative effort I led as part of a William &amp; Mary Game Design class, with William Cross, William Kyle, and Raymond Wang. Infinite Automata is a roguelike bullethell in the vein of games like <a href="https://enterthegungeon.com/">Enter the Gungeon</a> and <a href="https://www.realmofthemadgod.com/">Realm of the Mad God</a>. This is the sum result of only four months of effort, and consists entirely of original visual assets. Built in C++ using the libraries <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2">tinyxml2</a>, and <a href="https://box2d.org/">Box2D</a>.</p>
        <p>In addition to leading the team, I contributed primarily to the wave control logic, some XML file parsing, and the GUI design.</p>

        <p>For hackathon <a href="https://www.tribehacks.com/2022/index.html">Cypher VII</a>, I collaborated with <a href="https://devpost.com/jruxton37">Jonathan Ruxton</a> to create a visual application using Java's swing components to simulate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>, but where the borders between cells can break down as a result of extended activity. The application also features an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model">Sandpiles</a>.</p>
        <p>I primarily worked on the display aspects of the application, while my partner worked on the logic of generations. We also had invaluable assistance from <a href="https://github.com/GreenGem-ButOnGitHub">Tetra</a>, who helped us generate and solidify the idea during the Hackathon.</p>

        <p>Quartic is a programming language with assembly syntax that compiles to the esoteric language <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/4">4</a>. The most interesting challenge in 4, and by extension, Quartic, is that there is a finite memory of 100 cells, each containing an arbitrarily large integer. I designed Quartic because I wanted to prove 4 to be Turing Complete by proof of emulation, utilizing bigintegers as arbitrarily large data structures. To this end, I needed a simpler, more controlled way to organize my efforts. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ConorOBrien-Foxx/4Compiler/main/examples/quartic/turing-complete-min.quartic">This file</a> (snippet pictured above left) is an interpreter for the Turing Complete <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Boolfuck">Boolfuck</a> language, storing the data tape as a very large integer. The corresponding compiled 4 program is pictured above right.</p>
        <p>I wrote the Quartic compiler in Ruby, and it is able to compile to 4 and to <a href="https://dlang.org/">D</a>, and, by extension, to an executable file. The same compiler framework is also used to generate a "prettified" version of 4, and can help unobfuscate existing 4 source code files into (more) readable, commented code. The esolang page linked above features Quartic's specification, including basic arithmetic commands, loops, branching, and preprocessing instructions.</p>

        <p>A stack-based programming language written in JavaScript. Written with keeping both readability and concision in mind. A simple passion project started in December 2016, the language has grown to include quite a lot of functions. If you are interested in learning the syntax of the language, I would recommend reading <a href="https://github.com/ConorOBrien-Foxx/stacked/wiki/Tutorial-I:-a-stack-based-language">the wiki</a> and maybe perusing <a href="https://github.com/ConorOBrien-Foxx/stacked/blob/master/src/stdlib.js">the standard library</a>, as I the current language command documentation is sparse at best.</p>
