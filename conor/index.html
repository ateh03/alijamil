        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> What determines if we are free? Free will has long been the subject of heavy debate, and useful for determining moral responsibility. I propose that an agent is <em>morally responsible</em> for an action and its <em>reasonably foreseeable consequences</em> if and only if that agent <em>feels free</em> in doing that action. In so claiming, I investigate what it means to <em>feel free</em>, and what we can reasonably expect an agent to foresee.

        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Previous surveys of security vulnerabilities have predominately focused on static identification. This paper seeks to fill the relatively unexamined niche in security survey literature which examines the design of programming languages themselves. It examines the vulnerability features of particular programming languages, as well as general features of programming languages, and potential methods used to mitigate the issues arising thereof. I express the language design maxims of Security-convenience alignment, Security consciousness, and Programmer-first safety.</p>
