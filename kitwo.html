            <h1>KI #2: On Privilege & Intersectionality</h1>
            <h5> On acknowledging my own privilege, practicing gratitude and getting involved.</h5>
            <p>The black woman countered and said “I’m not so sure. Let me ask you a question: When you look in the mirror what do you see?” The white woman said “I see a woman,” to which the black woman responded “That’s the problem. When I look in the mirror I see a black woman. To me, race is visible. To you it is invisible” My knowledge on feminist history and theory does not run deep, but I had learned of misogynoir, or the ingrained prejudice against Black women.

            <p>As these stupefying words washed over me, I couldn’t help but agree. While privilege in our society certainly exists, it is so intangible and multifaceted that truly every individual has unique privileges to a degree. Where I lack privilege in some aspects of my life, I have patriarchal privilege by being a man. This is all according to an individual’s positionality, or where they stand in relation to social identities like gender, race, ethnicity and geographical location. Whatever preconceived notions I had towards the world and demographics I encounter as I navigate the world is according to these theories in positionality and intersectionality. While positionality more so aligns itself with one’s self concept, intersectionality explores discrimination determinant on individual identities. Coined by American civil rights activist Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw, intersectionality is a tool used to describe how different factors of identity and discrimination can meet at an intersection and affect someone's life. In the (virtual) classroom, a course I thought I would not treat differently than any other elective ended up leaving me contemplative of the many facets of my identity. And on the first day…
