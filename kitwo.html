            <h1>KI #2: On Privilege & Intersectionality</h1>
            <h5> On acknowledging my own privilege, practicing gratitude and getting involved.</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>In taking <b>Introduction to Women’s Gender Studies (WGST 112)</b> over the summer, of the videos we were assigned to watch, one in particular stuck out to me, and will stay with me for the rest of my life. Taking the course to knockout a liberal arts and enjoy learning more about feminist theory (as the fine majority of my role models and inspirations are women). For the first week of virtual class, students were tasked with watching a TED Talk by Michael Kimmel, American sociologist, on why gender equality benefits everyone and why men should embrace feminism. 
            </p>  
            <p>Kimmel sets the stage following his study group in graduate school. Notably, all 11 members of the study group were women except for Kimmel. Antics ensue when he recalls that before courses were revealed for the semester, the graduate students would get together to study– or in this case, have a weekly potluck. Kimmel recollects the exact moments of an “interaction that changed [my] life.” This conversation was between two women, one white and one black. The white woman stated that “All women face the same oppression as women. All women are similarly situated in patriarchy, and therefore all women have a kind of intuitive solidarity or sisterhood” (By this point in the video, I was hooked). The black woman countered and said “I’m not so sure. Let me ask you a question: When you look in the mirror what do you see?” The white woman said “I see a woman,” to which the black woman responded “That’s the problem. When I look in the mirror I see a black woman. To me, race is visible. To you it is invisible.” My knowledge on feminist history and theory does not run deep, but I had learned of misogynoir, or the ingrained prejudice against Black women. Though not entirely dissimilar from misogyny, the prejudice against women, race is the factor that sets these two apart. While self-concept does vary depending on race, gender, financial background, location and upbringing, this was the first time I was exposed to the world of intersectionality. To quote, the black woman said something rather startling.

            <p>As these stupefying words washed over me, I couldn’t help but agree. While privilege in our society certainly exists, it is so intangible and multifaceted that truly every individual has unique privileges to a degree. Where I lack privilege in some aspects of my life, I have patriarchal privilege by being a man. This is all according to an individual’s positionality, or where they stand in relation to social identities like gender, race, ethnicity and geographical location. Whatever preconceived notions I had towards the world and demographics I encounter as I navigate the world is according to these theories in positionality and intersectionality. While positionality more so aligns itself with one’s self concept, intersectionality explores discrimination determinant on individual identities. Coined by American civil rights activist Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw, intersectionality is a tool used to describe how different factors of identity and discrimination can meet at an intersection and affect someone's life. In the (virtual) classroom, a course I thought I would not treat differently than any other elective ended up leaving me contemplative of the many facets of my identity. And I had this revelation on the first day.
            </p>
            <p>To backtrack, at age 13 I discovered my propensity for volunteerism. Being privileged enough to grow up in a military family has allowed me the opportunity to live in and experience different cultures at a young age. Exposure to unique peoples and cultures at this age contributed to my own interpretation of intersectionality before I even knew what the term meant. I still take pleasure in investing in people and their backgrounds. I feel that people and cultures should continue sharing their ideas and history to connect with other demographics and find common ground. Intersectionality is a beautiful concept, though rooted in assessing marginalization, focusing on the flip side of that involves celebrating our many similarities and differences that make us unique. So, naturally, I call myself a humanitarian. The burning desire to enact my valuation for community, culture and people manifested in the form of my journey for volunteerism.
            </p>
            <p>Summer 2022 commenced, and I closed up shop and put away my CSCE 240 Advanced Programming Technique textbook. I knew I wanted to kick off the summertime recess by taking advantage of living so close to downtown Columbia. I felt that I wasn’t quite ready to start working yet, so I took to researching local community events that I could easily sign up for. I discovered that Richland County houses a myriad of volunteer events that cater to any interests, and I most resonated with the South County Democratic Party (SCDP). Thanks to their simplified signup process, I was easily able to register to volunteer for a cookout outreach event within the next week. The outreach event was specifically for local individuals experiencing homelessness, and immediately I was exposed to a new channel of individuals I’d never met who also valued volunteering as much as I do. I’m pleased to say that when I started getting involved in these activities, I found it hard to stop. Serving those experiencing homelessness further put into place the absoluteness of intersectionality. Here before me were people of varying ages and ethnicities, completely different backgrounds experiencing the same hardship. I had thought that the discrimination they face in their social identity was not subject to race nor gender, but to class. Further looking under the lens of intersectionality, I understood that each individual experiencing the harshness of homelessness could be discriminated against for multiple aspects of their identity. 
            </p>
            <p>Yes, while two individuals going through the same hardship may share discrimination in class, how does discrimination evolve if they are of two different races? If one is queer and the other is heterosexual? If one is a woman and one is a man? This concept shed so much light into how I understood identity, but frustrated me. Unlike technology and the cyber fields I have dedicated the majority of my life to, this wasn’t objective. There was no right or wrong answer. Instead, there were people. Real-life people who each had a family, an upbringing, a background and unique life experiences that only they could fathom the full scope of.
