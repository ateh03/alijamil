            <h1>KI #1: The Tip of the Cyber Iceberg</h1>
            <h5> On my first internship, finding my vocation in the cybersecurity rabbithole and learning to trust intuition.</h5>
            <div class="kionetext">
              <p>My junior year matriculating at USC, something miraculous happened. I spent weeks that August applying to a myriad of computing internships, to no avail. Seeing as my mantra is “rejection is redirection”, I ceased the grueling application cycle and instead decided to dedicate my time to my role as then-Program Specialist at the Boys & Girls Club and to my Fall semester classes. Everything changed when a few weeks into September I received a phone call early one Friday morning. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) of the South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce (DEW) had called me, and stated that I had been selected to participate in <a href="https://dew.sc.gov/news/2022-04/sc-department-employment-and-workforce-announces-its-cybersecurity-internship-program" target="_blank">DEW’s inaugural cybersecurity internship</a> that had just launched in July, as a member of the second cohort. Completely bewildered and ecstatic that I had finally found an internship, I gladly accepted. Two weeks later I found myself sitting through the orientation and onboarding process, completely unaware of how much knowledge I would accrue over the six month duration of the program, nor the lifelong connections I would make along the way.
              <br></p>
              <p>Going into my junior year, I had very little knowledge of what I deem the “Cybersecurity Iceberg.” My program curriculum requires all CIS majors take <b>CSCE 201 “Intro to Computer Security”</b>, which covers basic security policies, incident response, risk management, basic cryptography and ends with students giving a presentation on the practice of security. As much as I enjoyed this class and its extremely talented lecturer Dr. Neema Kanapala, ingenuously, I didn’t realize just how deep this Iceberg was. While CSCE 201 introduced students to concepts like non-repudiation, encryption and common vulnerabilities, my time at DEW delved deep into the rabbit hole. My first week at DEW, interns were exposed to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, a large dynamic list of cyber adversaries' behaviors and tactics, shadowing our fellow interns from Cohort 1 and familiarizing ourselves with networking and security foundations through Linkedin Learning courses. My first month of the internship program was completely transformative, not only reacquainting me with information security principles I had learned during the previous semester, but led to a rapid paradigm shift in my approach to computing as a whole. As an extremely detail-oriented person, I can fail to see the bigger picture. DEW’s internship ensured that students were able to connect the various realms of computer science. Whereas I once oversimplified the cybersecurity discipline to users having good cyber hygiene and updating their software, working as a security analyst put into perspective the entirety of the “Information Technology (IT) umbrella.” Pitched to me by one of my many advisors affiliated with the program, the IT umbrella is composed of all the realms of computing, truly confirming that tech does bridge all other sectors. Being able to recognize that IT is more than just troubleshooting or developing has done wonders for my journey, allowing my one-dimensional perspective of the sector I am prepared to devote my life to into endless possibilities– whether I decided to pick up .NET or C and go the cloud computing pathway, read up on my ports and protocols to pursue the networking pathway, studying up on business and data privacy laws for the governance, risk and compliance (GRC) pathway, or being well-versed in system vulnerabilities and remediating compromised assets for the cybersecurity pathway. Since I have had the epiphany that the options and opportunities of where to steer my vocational career are limitless, it has fueled my ambition to ensure that in this life, I can achieve any feat I set my mind to.

              <p>According to numerous research studies, those in tech suffer from imposter syndrome more frequently than those that aren’t. I served as no exception to those statistics. My first two months into the internship were stress-inducing, as interns were not trained through simulation based training. Instead, everything we did was on the live network– meaning that in responding to a ticket, clicking on a malicious URL would actually trigger a breach to a local government agency. Miraculously, no intern ever did cause a data breach! No matter, the pipeline from taking an area of my studies that I had superficial knowledge in and applying it everyday for six months did wonders not only for my expertise on the subject-matter, but helped me build confidence in problem-solving security queries, and further bridged what I’d gleaned in my concurrent classes those two semesters. I am so grateful for being given the opportunity to participate, and hadn’t seriously considered a career in cybersecurity. Since my completion of the program, I improved my investigation time requirements by 150%, developed, conducted  and participated in an interview coaching project “Project Rambo” for both cohorts, developed the first agency-wide phishing attack simulation with my workfellow regularly performed security operation tasks over 5,000+ devices and 600+ employees in South Carolina. I especially enjoyed playing project manager for the interview coaching project, where groups of four interviewed our CISO on any position and recorded how he responded to questions, as the wealth of accumulated knowledge was not just in potential roles interns aspired to pursue, but put me in my first leadership role. Managing groups, deadlines, personalities and time constraints though trying, certainly allowed me to develop myself as a leader. Good leaders effectively “go with the flow”, and are realistic about what is in their control and what is not. None of these projects would have been possible without the patience, guidance and opportunity provided by DEW and our CIO, Shane Simmons, who arranged for the entire program. Not only do I plan to apply the invaluable knowledge I gained to any and every tech position I land going forward, but I will continue to develop fluency in infosec, as cybersecurity is ubiquitous, and familiarity with the concepts and principles of information security is always considered a leg up to enterprises. Even as I write this, I am studying for CompTIA’s Security+ certification exam, which denotes proficiency in security baselines. 
              </p>
              <p>While my internship ended in March, things have come full circle this semester, as I am currently taking <b>CSCE 522 Information Security Principles</b>, only further reinforcing the cybersecurity concepts I practiced daily during the program. This surreal experience has no doubt bettered me as a CIS student at USC, and I am ecstatic to share my newfound affinity for cybersecurity with like-minded individuals and to enterprises in need.
